This is a project I built from the book "Create an Uber Clone in 7 Days: Build a Real World Full Stack Mobile App in Java.

In this small project I learned how to use the Codename One framework to build a small cross-platform app in Java, and also how to use the UI builder to build out the user interface.

In it, Todos can be written, saved, and deleted if they are completed.
